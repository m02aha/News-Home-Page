## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this news website homepage and get it looking as close to the design as possible.


## Your users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
## built with:
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- java script 


## What I learned :grinning:
This was an easy project to recap my understanding of css grid and flex box.
